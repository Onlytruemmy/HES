        <h1>HES Originals</h1>
        <p>HES stands for Hustle.Elevate.Standout. The name came from my initials Hundenu Emmanuel Sewedo
           but made it have a different meaning and thought of it because it 
           was a Hustle and I have to Elevate and Standout.</p>

            <h2>About the Brand</h2>
            <p> I'm a lover of fashion and having watched many run way fashion show
                I decided to start my own brand. I wanted to do something Unique and mindblowing. I had no capital or revenue to
                start but I just knew I had to start somewhere.The first design I made for HES was on the 8th of August 2025, I made a couple of
                designs after then.</p>

            <h2>My Project.</h2>
            <p>After surfing through the internet for apps I could use to design and get mockups I settled for canva amongst numerous
                options. All other apps were good but they were paid apps and were expensive for me to use at the time. Canva is a paid app
                also and it is affordable for me to use so I immediately settled for it. I used used canva to design the logos and the mockups.</p>
